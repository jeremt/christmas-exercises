Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

-   `answer[i] == "FizzBuzz"{:js}` if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
-   `answer[i] == "Fizz"{:js}` if i is divisible by 3.
-   `answer[i] == "Buzz"{:js}` if i is divisible by 5.
-   `answer[i] == i{:js}` (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

## Example 1:

Input: `n = 3{:js}`
Output: `["1","2","Fizz"]{:js}`

## Example 2:

Input: `n = 5{:js}`
Output: `["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]{:js}`
